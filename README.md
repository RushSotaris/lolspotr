League of Legends Statistic Calculators

This is an R package designed to provide R users with a way to quickly calculate in-game statistics for League of Legends. 
So far this package covers several important stats, such as Movement Speed, Attack Speed, Lethality and other types of armor penetration mechanics, as well as CDR.
It comes provided with a starting data table consisting of all champion base values in League of Legends as of 5/1/22. An updated table can be created using the lolscrape() function.
